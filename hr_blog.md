Increased flexibility: Allowing employees to work from anywhere, at any time, as long as they meet their performance goals.
Improved collaboration: Facilitating face-to-face interactions and team building, while also promoting remote collaboration and communication.
Enhanced productivity: Enabling employees to work in environments that suit their individual needs and preferences.
